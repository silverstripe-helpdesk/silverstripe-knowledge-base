# Silverstripe Knowledge Base

## Purpose

A clean mechanism to organize, tag, and share knowledge.

## Requirements

* Silverstripe 3.1.13

## To Developers

### Develpment Guidelines

As a general guideline for syntax organization you should follow [Silverstripe's Coding Convention](http://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4.0/getting_started/coding_conventions/).

As program structure is concerned you should follow [Eric Raymondâ€™s 17 Unix Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Eric_Raymond.E2.80.99s_17_Unix_Rules).

### Functional Requirements

A simple, clean, and very basic theme must be provided, but it is not the intention of this module to provide such interface. It is intention of this module to provide a simple, yet powerfull, mechanism to store, review, and find information articles.

#### Feature Set

* Full Text Search
  Any kind of information database that does not provide a reliable search engine to find the information one needs, doesn't exist.
* Tagging
  A categorization method is essential to subject based findings. Tagging is the simpliest way to provide such categorization while providing most of the features of more complex categorization alternatives.
* Markdown Based
  Titles, list, and simple paragraphs are one of the oldest text based technologies. Markdown provides an incredible simple way to organize text based information with such technologies.
* Revision Control
  It is essential to keep a record of work done to an existing information article. It is not of any use, thought, to hold on to obsolete information.
* Access Control
  While not a primary concern of this module, group and user based access control must be provided on write methods of information articles.
