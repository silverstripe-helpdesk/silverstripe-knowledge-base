## To Developers

### Develpment Guidelines

As a general guideline for syntax organization you should follow [Silverstripe's Coding Convention](http://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4.0/getting_started/coding_conventions/).

As program structure is concerned you should follow [Eric Raymondâ€™s 17 Unix Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Eric_Raymond.E2.80.99s_17_Unix_Rules).

### Functional Requirements

A simple, clean, and very basic theme must be provided, but it is not the intention of this module to provide such interface. It is intention of this module to provide a simple, yet powerfull, mechanism to store, review, and find information articles.
